## <ins>Idea
- Virtual window

- To space out and focus, and take breaks

___
## <ins>Function
- **background atmosphere/environment while working**

- **Two kinds of breaks:**

    - relaxing background noises
    - not too distracting
    - lets you sink in work without checking the clock or thinking about having to take a break
    - Adapts the sounds to the "mood"/stress level/noise around
    - gives the feeling that youre working somewhere more relaxing

  - <ins> Active break
    - sense when you need a break (or reminds you after a set amount of time)
      - Variable heart rate
      - puls etc
      - microphone (breathing rate, chair moving, other noises)
    - notes/voice memo to write down/record before break, and get reminded after break 
    - more visuals
    - "space out" in your thoughts
