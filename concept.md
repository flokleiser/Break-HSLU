### Concept buzzwords 

#### <ins>Idea

- **Virtual window**
  - central "theme" that ties it together

- **For me specifically**
  - (people with adhd)
  - time blindness (?)

- **To space out and focus, and take breaks**

#### <ins>Function
- **Background atmosphere/environment while working**
  - Calm, ambient, nostalgic

- **Passive break**
  - relaxing background noises  
  - not too distracting
  - lets you sink in work without checking the clock or thinking about having to take a break
  - Adapts the sounds to the "mood"/stress level/noise around
  - gives the feeling that youre working somewhere more relaxing

- **Active break**
  - more visual
  - "space out" in your thoughts
  - write down notes   

- **Productivity tools/helpful stuff to take breaks (?)**
  - notes/voice memo to write down/record before break, and get reminded after break 
  - sense when you need a break (or reminds you after a set amount of time)
    - Variable heart rate
    - puls etc
    - microphone (breathing rate, chair moving, other noises)

#### <ins>Design 
- **Scenes**
  - Different environments, weather, season, time of day

- **Sounds**
  - Background noise/"brown noise" to fit with scene and to relax

- **UI/UX**
  - Choose scenery, time of day, weather, season
  - Choose break "interval" or "threshhold"
  - Write down notes --> to remember where you were
