# What is break for me

**environment/surroundings:**
    peaceful atmosphere

    relaxing/calm/soothing sounds
        (rain, campfire, distant chatter)

    nice visuals
        not too distracting, comfortable, allows to daydream/let thoughts free
        changes perspective on bigger picture instead of zoomed in view

    example: looking out of my window, at the facades and rooftops of the old town

**requirements/prerequisites:**
    no time blindness 
        no checking time constantly

    being able to leave work behind for a couple of minutes

    no feeling of guilt that you forgot/are forgetting something

    easy way of getting back into work


# How it helps to use/train break 

**concept**:    "Virtual window" that simulates different views/atmospheres and helps you take breaks when you need them.
                Helps to remove the hard lines of work vs break, smoother transition, not time based but productivity/stress based 

**helps taking breaks/detects when you need a break**
    reminder that certain amount of time has passed OR
    detects if stressed/fidgety/restless --> microphone/sounds, variable heart rate
    detects if productivity decreases --> words per minute written/clicks per minute

**functionality while working**
    background soundscape, "brown noise" --> helps to focus and not get distracted

**functionality while on break**
    virtual window, simulation of being somewhere else
    selection of different scenes, windowframes, soundscapes, weather and time of day


**helps getting back into work** 
    **notes** function that reminds you what you were working on
