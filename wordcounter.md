concept 

"Virtual Window" is a tool that blurs the lines between work and breaks, and helps to transition between the two.
While working, it helps the user stay focused with a background soundscape and prompts a break when it detects stress levels and productivity dips.

While taking a break, the virtual window acts as a screen saver, allowing the user to chose from different windows to look out of, different scenes to look at, different weather to look at the scene in, and with a notes function for task reminders, it allows to completely clear the mind until going back to work.
